    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy beef Wellington recipe was taught to me when I lived in England. Note that beef Wellington should always be served with the centre slightly pink.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2.5 pounds beef tenderloin</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, softened, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>0.5 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 ounces liver pate</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk, beaten</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red wine</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220 degrees Celsius.</li>
        <li>Place beef tenderloin in a small baking dish. Spread 2 tablespoons softened butter over beef.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove beef from the pan; allow to cool completely. Reserve pan juices.</li>
        <li>Increase oven temperature to 230 degrees Celsius.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion and mushrooms in butter for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
        <li>Mix together paté and 2 tablespoons softened butter in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Spread paté mixture over beef. Top with onion and mushroom mixture.</li>
        <li>Roll out puff pastry dough to about 1/4-inch thickness and place beef in the center. Fold up and seal all the edges, making sure the seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9x13-inch baking dish, cut a few slits in the top of dough, and brush with egg yolk.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 220 degrees C and continue baking until pastry is a rich, golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Place reserved pan juices in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in beef broth and red wine; boil until slightly reduced, 10 to 15 minutes. Strain and serve with beef.</li>
    </ol>
